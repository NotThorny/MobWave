# MobSpawn Basics

This is a simple plugin to easily generate "waves" of random enemies to fight.
This pulls from a *nearly* complete list of monsters. Too many bosses were spawning so I removed a bunch.
Azdha was removed for appearing in every 4 of 5 runs.

There will probably be issues if you don't use the commands as intended so follow the usage.
Don't blame me if you spawn 100000 mobs and crash your game/server.

## Usage

 /mobwave or /mw
 `/mw start` Will generate one wave of 5 random enemies at level 10.
 `/mw create [# of waves] [# of monsters] [level of mobs]` Create a custom set of waves, each wave will last for 1 minute by default.

 A stop command exists but currently does nothing, so don't put a million waves.

# Version

This uses the Grasscutters plugin template for 1.3.1 (updated for new spawn command usage).

## Issues

I don't know any yet but there are probably a few.
This plugin will only work on GC 1.3.1+ unless spawn command gets changed again.
